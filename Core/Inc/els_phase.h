/*
 * ELS phase-correction math, extracted as a pure function so it can be unit
 * tested in isolation (no HAL / struct deps). Used by applyPhaseCorrection in
 * Ramps.c and by the els_phase permutation tests.
 *
 * Background (2026-06 thread-phase investigation): the previous code computed
 * phaseError = idealAdvance - actualAdvance, which is only correct when the
 * spindle's idealAdvance and the carriage's actualAdvance run in the SAME
 * direction through a cut. On a real machine the Z DRO and the leadscrew can run
 * OPPOSITE (a cutting-direction servo move makes the DRO count the other way);
 * for those setups the quantity that is invariant at the Z-triggered stop is
 * idealAdvance + actualAdvance, and using the minus form makes the thread phase
 * walk 2x the configured backlash. The correct, config-derived sign is
 *
 *     droSign = stopDirection * cuttingDir
 *
 * (the cut feeds the carriage in stopDirection while the servo runs in
 * cuttingDir, so droSign is how a cutting-direction servo move changes the DRO).
 * phaseError = idealAdvance - droSign * actualAdvance handles BOTH polarities.
